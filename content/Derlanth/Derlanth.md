Gloaming forests span much of Derlanth, the ambient light ever casting strange and living shadows on the verdant ground.  Carefully-maintained clearings and verdant meadows provide some succor from the gloom, but the gleaming eyes of the deep wood are never far from where the Provinces spread.  Derlanth is the land of the hunt, and to prosper beneath its boughs is to become in some way a predator.  Mana turned to luminous amethyst is often the only source of illumination in the forest, a comforting mirror to the shrouded skies above.
