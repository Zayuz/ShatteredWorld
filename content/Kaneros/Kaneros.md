A land of red clay and black sands, verdant Kaneros is a land of life from death.  Lush rainforests ripple across expanses of land interrupted by the towering remnants of some divine and fallen titan, its bones now the foundation of your world.  The molten fire of his life’s blood still wells up from underground, birthing new volcanos and sending streams of lava to fall into the swirling abyss below.  Mana in Kaneros crystallizes into amber, clinging in rivulets to its most ancient trees and glowing impervious at the center of deep lava flows.
