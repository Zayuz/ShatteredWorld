Mist and fog embrace the floating isles of Sanmah, where light and sound are rarely to be trusted.  Here, placid lakes sit nestled among hills ever-wet with morning dew, and the sparkle of rainbows shine down on rivers whose flow is as mercurial as the mortal heart.  Beyond these oases, the land’s gleam turns sharp, as rolling landscapes of glass and crystal enchant the eye even as they draw blood.  The elements are a playful force that the people of Sanmah must ever contend with, for good and for ill.  Mana is often found on riverbeds or nestled in fields of lily pads as gleaming opal, its innumerable colors a mirror to Sanmah’s innumerable moods.
