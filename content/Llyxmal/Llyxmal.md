Frigid winds and grinding cliffs of ice dominate Llyxmal’s frozen tundras, the elemental ice preserving scenes of marine life not seen since the breaking of the world.  Life flourishes despite the grinding inevitability of Llyxmal’s glaciers, as herds traverse the snowfields and forests of evergreens cling stubbornly to the frozen ground, though all things that thrive in the cold see their bodies irrevocably warped.  Further from the heart of the Demesne, the glaciers begin to thaw, feeding ice floes the size of small islands.  Though encased in ice, it is possible to mine the mana that has frozen into emerald, a rich reward to those willing to risk Llyxmal’s ferocious blizzards.
