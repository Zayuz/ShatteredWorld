In Empire! you play as the ruler of a Province. You perform actions to advance your Province’s position in the world through fair means and foul. Once your ruler dies of old age, disease, accident or murder, or they are otherwise replaced, their heir takes over, becoming your new ruler.

> The Shattered World exists in the shadow of numerous apocalyptic magical events, and a number of common fantasy tropes have their place in the GMs’ plans.  If your concept involves interaction with or playing as dragons, demons, angels, fey, the undead, titans, or elder gods, the GM team may have additional notes to work with you in order to reconcile your vision with theirs.
